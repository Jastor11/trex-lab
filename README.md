# Build a T-Rex for T-Rex in P5

T-Rex needs some new artwork! Let's put our creativity and our new P5 skills to work to build them some cool virtual dinos.

### Your task

Your goal for this lab is to use the P5 library to draw a T-Rex. Feel free to get as creative as you would like for this one. Let your imagination run wild! At a minimum your T-Rex should have:

* a head with razor sharp teeth
* a body with legs, arms, and a tail

#### Resources:
* [P5 Library](https://p5js.org/reference/) 
* Google


#### This syntax in P5 might be useful, but be sure to reference the [P5 Documentation](https://p5js.org/reference/) for more tools that are available to you.

Triangle:
```
triangle(x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3)

Quadrilateral:
```
quad(x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3,x4,y4)
```
Fill:
```

```

#### Here's some inspiration to get you started!
